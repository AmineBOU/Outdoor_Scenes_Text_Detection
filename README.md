Text Detection, Natural Image, Arbitrary Orientation, MSRA Text Detection 500 Database

### Tasks:

* Understand the problem of text detection on natural images
* Examine the dataset 
* Develop an algorithm according to the principles proposed in <a href = "http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~cernyad2/TextCaptchaPdf/Detecting%20Text%20in%20Natural%20Scenes%20with%20Stroke%20Width%20Transform.pdf"></a> or define another algorithm
* Experimental validation.
* Evaluate by characterizing and comparing the best and the worst application conditions of the developed algorithm.
